A text-based choose your own adventure game using HTML, CSS, and JS

My motivation behind making this game is I really enjoy story-telling and playing/making games. I loved CYOA books as a kid and playing games where your choices alter the outcome of the game.

I used the Giphy API in this project to act out the different death scenes and for the final congratulations scene.

The game features many different scenes which you can access through choosing one of the various options that populate on every new scene. It includes some graphic gifs that are tied to the death scenes as well as a gif for if you make it to the end.
